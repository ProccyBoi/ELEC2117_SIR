# SOLVE_MODEL(1) - Julia Function Documentation

## NAME
**solve_model** - Solve an ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation) problem using the `DifferentialEquations.jl` library.

## SYNOPSIS
```
solve_model(problem)
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **solve_model** function serves as a wrapper around the `solve` function provided by the `DifferentialEquations.jl` library. It simplifies the process of solving ordinary differential equation (ODE) problems by taking an `ODEProblem` object as input and returning the computed solution.

The function abstracts the detailed setup and directly returns the solution object, which contains the solution values, time points, and other metadata. It is useful when you want to quickly solve a problem defined by `ODEProblem` and retrieve the results without handling additional options.

## PARAMETERS
**problem**  
: A pre-defined `ODEProblem` object representing the system of differential equations to be solved. The `ODEProblem` must include:
  - A function defining the ODE (`f!(du, u, p, t)`).
  - Initial conditions (`u0`).
  - Time span for the solution (`tspan`).
  - Parameters (if applicable).

The `ODEProblem` object can be constructed using the `ODEProblem` constructor from the `DifferentialEquations.jl` library.

## RETURN VALUE
Returns an `ODESolution` object, which contains the solution for the given ODE problem. The solution object includes:

- **`t`**: A vector containing the time points at which the solution is evaluated.
- **`u`**: An array or vector of solution values corresponding to each time point.
- Additional fields and metadata related to the solution, such as the solver's performance and intermediate states.

## DIAGNOSTICS
**solve_model** returns an `ODESolution` object if the problem is solved successfully. However, the function will raise errors if:

- The input `problem` is not a valid `ODEProblem` object.
- The function `solve` encounters an error during the solution process (e.g., incompatible time span or initial conditions).

## NOTES
- Ensure that the `DifferentialEquations` package is correctly installed and imported before using this function.
- Always validate the `ODEProblem` before passing it to `solve_model` to prevent runtime errors.

## SEE ALSO
- `solve` from the `DifferentialEquations.jl` package.
- `ODEProblem` for defining ODE problems.
